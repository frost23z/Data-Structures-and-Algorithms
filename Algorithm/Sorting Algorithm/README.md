## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that iterates through a list of elements, compares each pair of adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order (ascending or descending). The algorithm repeats this process until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.
